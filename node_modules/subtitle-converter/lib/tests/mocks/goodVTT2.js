12
00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.466

54
00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.432
<b>It is a cave in the</b>

<b>All around there</b>

<b>This is where man</b>

<b>The discovery of</b>

61
00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.200

<b>Nobody expected original worship

65
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.000
<b>It is in all the</b>

<b>And they all tell</b>

67
00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:53.432
<b>In the beginning the serpent was

<b>Mankind in comparison</b>

<b>From that day</b>

<b>We cannot say exactly when,

<b>of the moment the serpent aliens

85
00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:43.632
<b>came from the skies.

00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:49.599
<b>We can uncover the</b>
<b>story of what happened

87
00:04:49.632 --> 00:04:52.466
<b>next and how it has</b>
<b>affected our own time.

88
00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.599
<b>The truth is aliens</b>
<b>do walk among us

89
00:04:55.632 --> 00:04:56.833
<b>right now.

90
00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.399
<b>To many the very idea</b>

<b>hidden within our</b>
<b>religions and mythology

92
00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:07.599
<b>will seem bizarre.

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:13.332
<b>In Christianity and other faiths

<b>of a fearful and</b>
<b>waring past between

96
00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.699
<b>mankind and the serpent.

97
00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.100
<b>Nevertheless, the</b>
<b>historical truth

98
00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:30.699
<b>is that the serpent</b>
<b>is there and it is

99
00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:32.532
<b>the root of all major religions.

100
00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:35.532
<b>This has been proven</b>

102
00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.766
<b>The following information</b>

<b>understanding of</b>
<b>this history for it

104

<b>helps us to uncover</b>

<b>of this ancient invasion.

106
00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:54.699
<b>This is a journey</b>

<b>(celestial music)

109
00:06:02.165 --> 00:06:05.199
<b>The easiest and most</b>

<b>that the serpent is</b>
<b>hidden in our lives

111
00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:09.632
<b>is to actually</b>

<b>of the serpent itself.

113
00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:17.699
<b>We need to get to the roots.

<b>The snake is known in</b>
<b>the language of Canaan

00:06:20.366 --> 00:06:25.366
<b>as Ab, Oub, Oph, Op, Eph and Ev.

116

<b>Amazing in the</b>
<b>Mayan language Can

117
00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:31.332
<b>means serpent as in Kukulcan,

<b>the bird serpent.

119
00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:34.599
<b>And just as in the</b>
<b>ancient Sumerian

<b>Akan, in the Scottish</b>
<b>can for serpent

121
00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:39.232
<b>which is where we</b>
<b>get the word Canny

<b>and vul for fire.

126
00:06:51.632 --> 00:06:53.766
<b>Showing an etymological</b>
<b>link across

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:55.099
<b>thousands of miles.

128
00:06:55.132 --> 00:06:57.499
<b>The aspect of fire</b>
<b>being included

129
00:06:57.532 --> 00:06:59.699
<b>in the word is a</b>

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:03.532

<b>(celestial music)

198
00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:05.232
<b>Baal is the ethereal</b>

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:12.399

00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:15.366

00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:24.399
<b>The European Beltane</b>

206
00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:27.766
<b>Both words signifying</b>
<b>the dragon or serpent.

207
00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:30.898
<b>In fact, Tanit was the</b>

208
00:10:30.932 --> 00:10:33.566
<b>in Northern Africa who</b>

00:10:36.632 --> 00:10:39.332

211
00:10:39.366 --> 00:10:41.699
<b>becoming the root</b>

212
00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:48.632
<b>The name Tanit</b>
<b>means serpent lady

213
00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:51.299

<b>the role of Tanit in</b>

<b>All of these deities and names

232
00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:59.032

<b>He is said to have</b>

297
00:15:09.565 --> 00:15:11.565
<b>or serpent worship</b>
<b>where he taught

298

<b>that Christ was an incarnation</b>
<b>of the great serpent

299
00:15:14.199 --> 00:15:17.099
<b>who glided over the</b>
<b>cradle of the Virgin Mary

<b>(celestial music)

<b>But the worship of the</b>

<b>ancient than even Manis stated.

304
00:15:30.665 --> 00:15:33.099
<b>In Britain the</b>
<b>serpent god was Who,

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.065
<b>the dragon ruler of the world.

306
00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:37.232
<b>A statement</b>
<b>remarkably similar to

00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:38.265
<b>that of the Ophites.

308
00:15:38.299 --> 00:15:41.099
<b>The Druid was known as Anater.

<b>Now known as an Ater.

310

<b>And as the Ater was the</b>

311
00:15:46.099 --> 00:15:48.932
<b>the Druids were Ophites</b>
<b>of the original stock.

312
00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:51.366
<b>They worshiped</b>
<b>also Bali or Baal,

313
00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:54.299
<b>so in this respect the</b>
<b>Druids were probably

314

<b>A remnant of ancient</b>

<b>According to Herodotus</b>
<b>a sacred serpent

318

<b>at the Acropolis in Athens.

320

<b>These honey cakes</b>
<b>were marked Omphalos

00:16:18.199 --> 00:16:21.399
<b>The superstition of the</b>
<b>Omphalos was widespread

322
00:16:21.432 --> 00:16:22.832
<b>like the serpent.

323
00:16:22.865 --> 00:16:26.399
<b>Belief from India to</b>
<b>Greece, it is a bos or orb

324
00:16:26.432 --> 00:16:28.832
<b>with spiral lines</b>
<b>thought to represent

00:16:28.865 --> 00:16:30.165
<b>serpents coiled.

326
00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:31.965
<b>There are similar</b>
<b>markings on ancient

<b>stone monuments</b>
<b>across the world.

328
00:16:37.865 --> 00:16:40.132
<b>To the Etruscans</b>
<b>of ancient Italy

329
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:41.932
<b>the Omphalos was seen as a route

330
00:16:41.965 --> 00:16:43.165
<b>to another world.

331
00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:45.531
<b>It was placed in a</b>

<b>and the first fruits</b>
<b>offered into the trench

333
00:16:48.232 --> 00:16:51.032
<b>which was then covered</b>
<b>by a huge stone.

334
00:16:51.065 --> 00:16:53.498
<b>The entire city was</b>
<b>centered on the spot

335

<b>with all roads leading</b>
<b>to and from it.

336
00:16:55.865 --> 00:16:58.965
<b>This is a remnant of the</b>

<b>came from another</b>

00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:18.965
<b>or Python the Snake</b>
<b>and she was active

344
00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:22.199
<b>for over 1,000 years,</b>

00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:25.865
<b>from mundane day to day</b>

346
00:17:28.765 --> 00:17:31.299
<b>As throughout the history</b>
<b>of the mystical serpent

347
00:17:31.332 --> 00:17:34.299
<b>it has been associated</b>
<b>with powers of future sight

348
00:17:34.332 --> 00:17:37.232
<b>known to us today</b>
<b>as precognition.

349
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:40.199
<b>An indication that the</b>
<b>serpent is associated

350
00:17:40.232 --> 00:17:43.032
<b>strongly with prophecy</b>
<b>is the stark fact that

351
00:17:43.065 --> 00:17:46.366
<b>the words for divination</b>
<b>in Hebrew, Arabic and Greek

352
00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:48.232
<b>all mean serpent.

353
00:17:48.265 --> 00:17:51.898
<b>This alone indicates that</b>
<b>Hebrew, Arabic and Greek

354
00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:54.665
<b>are following the same</b>
<b>beliefs over a vast

355
00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:56.265
<b>period of time.

356
00:17:59.631 --> 00:18:03.165
<b>According to Ferguson</b>
<b>a 19th Century writer,

357
00:18:03.199 --> 00:18:05.431
<b>when we first meet</b>
<b>with serpent worship

358
00:18:05.465 --> 00:18:07.365
<b>either the wilderness</b>
<b>of Cyanine,

359
00:18:07.398 --> 00:18:10.299
<b>the groves of Epidaurus</b>
<b>or in the Sumerian Huts

360
00:18:10.332 --> 00:18:12.598
<b>the serpent is always</b>
<b>the Agatha Damon

361
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:15.299
<b>which in ancient Egypt</b>
<b>presided over the affairs

362
00:18:15.332 --> 00:18:18.032
<b>of men as the guardian</b>
<b>spirit of their houses.

363
00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:20.865
<b>Was the Asp of Rano,</b>
<b>the snake headed goddess

364
00:18:20.898 --> 00:18:23.465
<b>which is represented as</b>
<b>nursing the young princes.

365
00:18:23.498 --> 00:18:26.798
<b>That the idea of health</b>
<b>was intimately associated

366
00:18:26.832 --> 00:18:29.232
<b>with the serpent is</b>
<b>shown by the crown formed

367
00:18:29.265 --> 00:18:31.598
<b>of the asp or sacred thermoses.

368
00:18:31.631 --> 00:18:34.065
<b>Having been given</b>

00:18:34.099 --> 00:18:35.732

00:18:45.132 --> 00:18:46.765

<b>In fact, the word El</b>

<b>The king of the Gen</b>

<b>Wine and sugar were</b>

<b>He was the first</b>

<b>and build ships.

442
00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:47.565
<b>During his long reign</b>
<b>Zhumshide received

443
00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:49.598
<b>a warning that three</b>
<b>severe winters,

444
00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:51.598
<b>heavy snowfalls would</b>

<b>And all creation</b>

446
00:21:53.631 --> 00:21:56.565

<b>and killed by the</b>

<b>A later king of</b>

<b>of the art of</b>

461
00:22:35.999 --> 00:22:38.498
<b>The whole story of</b>
<b>Zohauc and Zhumshide

462
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:39.732
<b>is the struggle between

463
00:22:39.765 --> 00:22:42.231
<b>the culture of Persia</b>
<b>and the invading ancient

00:22:42.264 --> 00:22:45.098
<b>serpent race from Syria</b>
<b>which was seen as the evil.

465
00:22:48.732 --> 00:22:51.732
<b>It is the story of</b>
<b>powerful ancient serpent

00:22:51.765 --> 00:22:54.798
<b>rulers who came to</b>
<b>earth, taught mankind,

467

<b>mated with humans and eventually

<b>fell into a situation of</b>

00:23:05.798 --> 00:23:08.999
<b>The exact same story</b>

<b>Egypt, the Bible</b>

<b>(celestial music)

<b>progenitors of the</b>

477

<b>of ancient times to</b>
<b>populate the earth.

479

<b>A hybrid species, part god</b>
<b>and part of the earth itself.

480

<b>Remarkably the origin</b>
<b>is found to be related

<b>to serpent worship from</b>
<b>their Sumerian origins.

482
00:23:40.198 --> 00:23:44.765
<b>(celestial music)

483
00:23:45.832 --> 00:23:48.431
<b>The word Hevia is</b>
<b>the root of Eve

484
00:23:48.465 --> 00:23:50.798
<b>and means female serpent.

485
00:23:50.832 --> 00:23:53.365
<b>It is connected to</b>
<b>the same Arabic root

486
00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:55.498
<b>which means both</b>
<b>life and serpent.

487
00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:00.765
<b>The Persians even call</b>
<b>the constellations

488

<b>serpents, the little Ava or Eve.

00:24:04.832 --> 00:24:07.898
<b>In old Acadian Ad</b>
<b>signifies father

00:24:07.932 --> 00:24:10.732

<b>with Seth, Saturn and</b>
<b>South who were all

<b>associated strongly as serpents.

493

<b>Abel the son of</b>
<b>Adam and Eve means

494
00:24:22.765 --> 00:24:25.164
<b>serpent shining and</b>
<b>Cain was thought

495
00:24:25.198 --> 00:24:28.098
<b>to be of serpent decent</b>
<b>simply because he was.

496
00:24:31.031 --> 00:24:33.932
<b>The other and important</b>
<b>in note is that

497
00:24:33.964 --> 00:24:35.998
<b>Adam and Eve were</b>
<b>initially immortal

498
00:24:36.031 --> 00:24:38.498
<b>and Eve gained her</b>
<b>wisdom via the serpent

499
00:24:38.531 --> 00:24:40.465
<b>on the Tree of</b>
<b>Knowledge and Life.

500
00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:45.798
<b>According to</b>
<b>Rabbinical tradition

501
00:24:45.832 --> 00:24:47.698
<b>Cain was not the</b>

502

00:25:14.298 --> 00:25:18.531
<b>The origin of humanity is</b>
<b>from the line of serpents.

512
00:25:19.898 --> 00:25:22.565
<b>American indigenous</b>
<b>people call the snake

513
00:25:22.598 --> 00:25:24.964
<b>anita wahay or supernatural.

514
00:25:24.998 --> 00:25:27.064
<b>It holds a high place</b>
<b>in their worship

515
00:25:27.098 --> 00:25:28.865
<b>because it is magical.

516
00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:34.031
<b>It controls the</b>
<b>rain and thunder,

517
00:25:34.064 --> 00:25:35.964
<b>has dominance over other animals

518
00:25:35.998 --> 00:25:37.131
<b>and plants.

519
00:25:37.164 --> 00:25:38.531
<b>It is no different</b>
<b>to the serpent

520
00:25:38.565 --> 00:25:40.164
<b>in other parts of the world.

521
00:25:40.198 --> 00:25:41.832
<b>Why would this be?

522
00:25:45.665 --> 00:25:47.865
<b>In a world where</b>
<b>historians tell us these

523
00:25:47.897 --> 00:25:50.198
<b>cultures never met</b>
<b>that they cannot

524
00:25:50.231 --> 00:25:53.331
<b>be related in any way and</b>
<b>yet the belief systems

525
00:25:53.365 --> 00:25:54.865
<b>are the same.

526
00:25:58.531 --> 00:26:01.931
<b>There is in fact</b>
<b>a clue, a big clue

527
00:26:01.964 --> 00:26:04.431
<b>in the tales and it</b>
<b>reveals the origin

528
00:26:04.465 --> 00:26:06.131
<b>of these serpent beliefs.

529
00:26:09.798 --> 00:26:12.331
<b>The rattlesnake was</b>
<b>according to legend

530
00:26:12.365 --> 00:26:13.598
<b>once a man.

531
00:26:13.631 --> 00:26:15.998
<b>Alluding to the ancient</b>
<b>incoming serpent race

532
00:26:16.031 --> 00:26:17.431
<b>of antiquity.

533
00:26:17.465 --> 00:26:20.231
<b>This man was transformed</b>
<b>into a rattlesnake

534
00:26:20.264 --> 00:26:22.765
<b>in order to bring</b>
<b>salvation to the human race

535
00:26:22.798 --> 00:26:24.031
<b>and save him.

536
00:26:24.064 --> 00:26:26.864
<b>Yet again, it is the</b>
<b>savior of mankind.

537
00:26:30.897 --> 00:26:33.031
<b>Even the Cherokee</b>
<b>Indians are afraid

538
00:26:33.064 --> 00:26:34.931
<b>of killing the rattlesnake</b>
<b>and will ask for

539
00:26:34.964 --> 00:26:37.931
<b>pardon from the snakes</b>
<b>ghost should they do so.

540
00:26:41.264 --> 00:26:43.931
<b>There is even a tradition</b>
<b>that if the snake

541
00:26:43.964 --> 00:26:47.264
<b>is hung on a tree for three</b>
<b>days it will bring rain.

542
00:26:47.298 --> 00:26:49.931
<b>Remarkably similar</b>
<b>to the Christian tale

543
00:26:49.964 --> 00:26:52.931
<b>and even a link with</b>
<b>Yahweh the rain god.

544
00:26:52.964 --> 00:26:55.198
<b>These are the same</b>
<b>because these are

545
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:57.931
<b>the same serpent deities</b>
<b>influencing society

546
00:26:57.964 --> 00:26:59.231
<b>across the globe.

547
00:26:59.264 --> 00:27:04.298
<b>(celestial music)

548
00:27:07.331 --> 00:27:10.897
<b>In mankind's efforts to</b>
<b>mimic their ancient deities

549
00:27:10.931 --> 00:27:13.431
<b>they began a peculiar tradition.

550
00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:14.831
<b>Circumcision.

551
00:27:14.864 --> 00:27:17.431
<b>There are wall carvings</b>
<b>in Egypt showing

552
00:27:17.465 --> 00:27:19.164
<b>circumcision being practiced.

553
00:27:19.198 --> 00:27:21.598
<b>The Egyptians held</b>
<b>the belief that when

554
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:24.498
<b>the snake shed its skin</b>
<b>it had undergone rebirth.

555
00:27:24.531 --> 00:27:26.897
<b>It was symbolic of</b>
<b>attaining new life,

556
00:27:26.931 --> 00:27:28.998
<b>of being born again.

557
00:27:29.031 --> 00:27:31.431
<b>It was a mirror of</b>
<b>their greatest god.

558
00:27:31.465 --> 00:27:36.465
<b>(celestial music)

559
00:27:39.064 --> 00:27:41.797
<b>The Egyptian priest</b>
<b>in a mock ritual

560
00:27:41.831 --> 00:27:43.531
<b>of the serpent shedding its skin

561
00:27:43.565 --> 00:27:46.098
<b>therefore removed the</b>
<b>foreskin of the male

562
00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:49.631
<b>and so the male was born</b>
<b>again like the snake.

563
00:27:49.665 --> 00:27:54.665
<b>(celestial music)

564
00:27:57.231 --> 00:28:00.198
<b>This practice then spread</b>
<b>to the Semitic peoples.

565
00:28:00.231 --> 00:28:02.598
<b>Arabs and Jews in later times.

566
00:28:02.631 --> 00:28:04.998
<b>Most probably via the</b>
<b>emerging worshipers

567
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:06.864
<b>of the serpent elite.

568
00:28:06.897 --> 00:28:09.331
<b>The fact is that this</b>
<b>practice goes back

569
00:28:09.365 --> 00:28:11.731
<b>to ancient Sumaria, the</b>
<b>home of the original

570
00:28:11.764 --> 00:28:14.665
<b>serpent shining ones who</b>
<b>came down from the sky.

571
00:28:14.698 --> 00:28:16.864
<b>The home of the</b>
<b>ancient watchers.

572
00:28:16.897 --> 00:28:21.897
<b>(celestial music)

573
00:28:23.565 --> 00:28:26.164
<b>The original home of</b>
<b>the angels of the Bible

574
00:28:26.198 --> 00:28:28.331
<b>who were shining</b>
<b>messengers of the gods

575
00:28:28.365 --> 00:28:30.897
<b>and whose visage was</b>
<b>that of the serpent.

576
00:28:32.998 --> 00:28:35.365
<b>There is no denying</b>
<b>that all the records

577
00:28:35.398 --> 00:28:37.665
<b>we have of these</b>
<b>shining ones record

578
00:28:37.698 --> 00:28:40.031
<b>them as having descended</b>
<b>from the heavens,

579
00:28:40.064 --> 00:28:42.331
<b>to be incredibly</b>
<b>wise and powerful,

580
00:28:42.365 --> 00:28:44.764
<b>to have set up a</b>
<b>special guardian race

581
00:28:44.797 --> 00:28:46.998
<b>called The Watchers</b>
<b>who then went on to

582
00:28:47.031 --> 00:28:50.031
<b>mate with humanity and</b>
<b>create a hybrid race.

583
00:28:50.064 --> 00:28:52.864
<b>That hybrid race is</b>
<b>known across the world

584
00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:54.831
<b>in folklore as the giants.

<b>(celestial music)

586
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:04.598
<b>History tells us</b>
<b>quite simply that this

587

<b>was a crime and the</b>
<b>original aliens,

588
00:29:06.731 --> 00:29:09.264
<b>the shining ones did</b>
<b>battle with the giants

589

<b>and brought about</b>
<b>a great cataclysm.

590

<b>This is not science fiction.

<b>(celestial music)

<b>The Ponti Tantra</b>

<b>animal and magical tales</b>
<b>and one of India's most

<b>influential contributions</b>

598
00:29:47.264 --> 00:29:49.431
<b>Said to have been</b>

<b>the third and fifth century AD,

600
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:53.998
<b>however it is believed</b>

<b>that they were already</b>

602
00:29:57.198 --> 00:30:00.598
<b>These stories substantially</b>

604
00:30:03.465 --> 00:30:05.797
<b>In it we can see the</b>

00:30:05.831 --> 00:30:08.064
<b>Braman culture and</b>
<b>the idea of serpents

609

<b>This indicates the sterile</b>
<b>nature of the Brahman

610
00:30:18.764 --> 00:30:20.098
<b>at this age.

611
00:30:20.131 --> 00:30:22.198
<b>One Devasarmon said to his wife,

<b>All her servants</b>

<b>the wedding of a</b>

<b>to arrange a wedding</b>

630
00:31:04.998 --> 00:31:07.198
<b>The Brahman replied,</b>

00:31:07.231 --> 00:31:09.498
<b>to the depths of Hell</b>
<b>and beseech Pasuki

634
00:31:14.864 --> 00:31:17.564
<b>But wives can be very</b>

635
00:31:17.597 --> 00:31:19.231

<b>far and wide to</b>
<b>seek out a bride.

637
00:31:21.764 --> 00:31:24.231
<b>He spent the night</b>
<b>in a place of Anaga

00:31:24.264 --> 00:31:25.564
<b>or serpent worshipers.

639
00:31:25.597 --> 00:31:28.398
<b>And in the morning told</b>

00:31:28.431 --> 00:31:30.931
<b>Amazingly the host had</b>
<b>the perfect daughter

<b>the girl and her servants.

643
00:31:38.931 --> 00:31:41.098
<b>After an initial</b>

<b>of marrying the snake</b>
<b>the girl eventually

645

<b>came around and</b>

<b>the early days, serving</b>

<b>But one night the</b>
<b>snake left his basket

<b>and crept into bed but</b>
<b>the girl thought it was

<b>The Brahman had seen everything

<b>could creep back</b>

<b>invasion of the shining</b>
<b>serpents in the mythology

681
00:33:32.365 --> 00:33:34.331

682
00:33:34.365 --> 00:33:36.831
<b>It's time to see if there</b>

00:33:36.864 --> 00:33:39.331

<b>(celestial music)

685
00:33:47.597 --> 00:33:51.331
<b>The fact is once our eyes</b>

686
00:33:51.365 --> 00:33:54.530
<b>of a massive world wide</b>
<b>serpent worship history

687
00:33:54.564 --> 00:33:56.331
<b>we cannot fail to see them.

688
00:33:56.365 --> 00:33:59.331
<b>Almost everything about</b>
<b>the mythology of the

689
00:33:59.364 --> 00:34:01.897
<b>alien serpent race</b>
<b>reveals that they were

690
00:34:01.931 --> 00:34:04.397
<b>the gods who gave</b>
<b>life and no symbol

691
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.331
<b>reveals this more than</b>
<b>the Ankh of ancient Egypt.

692
00:34:07.364 --> 00:34:12.564
<b>(celestial music)

693
00:34:12.597 --> 00:34:15.897
<b>The Ankh is a simple</b>
<b>t-cross surmounted

694
00:34:15.931 --> 00:34:18.264
<b>by an oval called</b>
<b>the Rue which means

695
00:34:18.298 --> 00:34:20.764
<b>quite simply gateway</b>
<b>to another world.

696
00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:25.397
<b>(celestial music)

697
00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:29.364
<b>This enigmatic symbol of Egypt

698
00:34:29.397 --> 00:34:31.998
<b>represents eternal life</b>
<b>and it was often found

699
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:34.731
<b>in the names of pharaohs</b>
<b>such as Tutankhamun.

700
00:34:34.764 --> 00:34:37.364
<b>The symbol is often</b>
<b>depicted being held

701
00:34:37.397 --> 00:34:40.198
<b>by a god to a pharo</b>
<b>giving him life

702
00:34:40.231 --> 00:34:42.164
<b>or held by a pharaoh</b>
<b>to his people

703

<b>giving them life.

704
00:34:43.298 --> 00:34:45.731
<b>This basically set</b>

705
00:34:45.764 --> 00:34:46.964
<b>from the mortals.

706
00:34:46.998 --> 00:34:49.298
<b>For anyone wearing</b>

707
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.264

<b>(celestial music)

709
00:34:57.564 --> 00:35:00.164
<b>The pharaoh was</b>
<b>god on earth and so

710
00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:02.131
<b>he held his own</b>
<b>symbol of the sun and

711
00:35:02.164 --> 00:35:03.630
<b>the serpent to his people.

712
00:35:03.664 --> 00:35:06.597
<b>It is the loop, the rue,</b>
<b>or gateway of the Onk

713
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.297
<b>which is held by the</b>
<b>immortals to the nostrils.

<b>(celestial music)

715
00:35:15.797 --> 00:35:17.597
<b>This is the same</b>

<b>breathing life into</b>
<b>the nostrils of Adam.

717
00:35:20.031 --> 00:35:22.464
<b>The Onk outlived</b>
<b>Egyptian domination

718
00:35:22.497 --> 00:35:24.497
<b>and was widely used</b>
<b>by the Christians

719
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.998
<b>as their first cross</b>
<b>but in this symbol

720
00:35:27.031 --> 00:35:29.330
<b>holds a clue to the</b>
<b>secret of the serpent.

721
00:35:29.364 --> 00:35:34.364
<b>(celestial music)

722
00:35:36.297 --> 00:35:37.964
<b>Philo said that the</b>
<b>Phoenician alphabet

<b>are those formed by</b>
<b>means of serpents

724

<b>the rulers of the universe.

00:45:58.896 --> 00:46:01.464

905
00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.730
<b>So Dragobert simply</b>

<b>of the dragons.

907
00:46:12.297 --> 00:46:14.930
