You want to run? I'll let you run.

20
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,667
Do you want it this way?

21
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,863
Can't move you.

22
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:31,039
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. It will be real quick, really quick.

23
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,421
One. Two.

25
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,830
Mom, I know. I just got off the plane.

26
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,515
Yu Da Hai is already here to pick me up.

27
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:08,875
Okay. Okay. I have to get my luggage. I'm hanging up.

<i> Da Hai</i>

29
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,661
My bad!

<i> The number you've dial is currently unavailable, please dial again later.</i>

<i> Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please?</i>

32
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:13,729
<i>Smells so good. Maybe he's at home boiling chicken soup.</i>

33
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,925
<i>So considerate.</i>

34
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:20,046
<i>Hurry and drive the car here.</i>

35
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:23,112
<i> What nonsense, when have you been afraid of the police?</i>

36
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:27,831
<i> Let me tell you, if you keep up with this nonsense, <br>I'm going to kill you today.</i>

37
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:32,223
<i> Hurry up, this is my big murder scene.</i>

38
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:35,278
<i>Thieves really don't go out empty.</i>

39
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:39,290
Get ready. Start off!

40
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:59,947
My precious casserole!

41
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:04,286
My chicken soup!

42
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,906
<br>

43
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:25,248
It hurts, hurts so much.

44
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:27,173
What are you doing?

45
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,749
You.

46
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:36,913
What do you want to do?

47
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:41,110
Come here, come here.

48
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,861
I need to call the police, I...

49
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:44,829
Call what police? You even call people?

50
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:45,710
Call what people?

51
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,395
What are you doing here? Our house doesn't have anything.

52
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:51,059
Go outside. <br>-I'm not a thief, I live here.

53
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,288
I was here cooking the chicken soup.

54
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,061
Are you stupid?

55
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:58,908
Coming to our house to make chicken soup?

56
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:02,246
This house is mine. I rented it with Da Hai.

57
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,323
There's no person called Da Hai here.

58
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,182
This is my house. I've already paid the fee.

59
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:11,335
What your house? Do you have evidence?

60
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:14,805
In the bedroom drawer, there's the contract and my ID.

61
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:17,185
You can go and take a look.

62
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:33,059
You, what are you doing?

63
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,016
How come your bed sheets are covered with blood?

64
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,614
Can there not be blood when you kill a chicken?

65
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,310
You were killing a chicken on your bed?

66
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,203
The chicken ran to the bed. I didn't want blood on the bed either.

67
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,812
Who exactly are you?

68
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:47,889
I...I live here.

69
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,868
You, is your last name Yu?

70
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,400
Yes.

71
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,597
Why didn't you say earlier? I'm your new roommate.

72
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:11,917
Mr... where is Prosperity Park?

73
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:13,472
This is it.

74
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:14,755
Where is the 26th building?

75
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:17,712
This is it.

76
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:24,159
Mom. Why are you here?

77
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,421
Can I not come? You and Yu Da Hai, are living together with no certainty.

78
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:31,325
If mother doesn't check for you, you're the one at loss in the future.

79
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,238
Where is Yu Da Hai?

80
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,424
Mom.

81
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,729
If this Yu Da Hai?

82
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:43,730
Who is this girl?

83
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,654
His sister.

84
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,525
<br>

85
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,745
My dear.

86
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:03,757
Could it be because I couldn't get the chicken soup,

87
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,594
you don't love me anymore?

88
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:08,595
That is not possible.

89
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:12,923
I won't accompany you up the building anymore, I still have a meeting.

90
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,292
Thank you for today.

91
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,891
It's nothing, nothing. Call me.

92
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,104
You scared me to death.

93
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,909
Who is that?

94
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,616
Co-worker.

95
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:49,704
The car sure is nice. Is he a rich 2nd generation son?

96
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:54,618
What? Are you jealous? I guess we have to go eat dumplings today,

97
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,346
or else it would be a waste of energy.

98
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:59,641
Stop joking. Let me tell you, keep your distance from that person.

99
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:03,283
He doesn't look like a good person, looks so suspicious.

100
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:06,882
Okay. In the future, the moment I see him, I'll run. Satisfied?

101
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:13,090
Are you not answering the call?

102
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,710
It's probably a call about selling insurance and all that jazz.

103
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:25,040
What are you doing?

104
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,062
I'm seeing what kind of insurance company is so insistent.

105
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:33,770
Chief son of nobility Xue, Xue Liang. Today was great.

106
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,184
Who is XueLiang? Was it the guy back then who was older than me?

107
00:09:38,184 --> 00:09:42,054
He looks like he's going bald. What did you two do today? So happy today?

108
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:43,370
Don't talk nonsense.

109
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,023
I'm speaking nonsense? Why are you lying to me right now?

110
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:48,882
You get jealous so easily, I was afraid that you'll get mad.

111
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:53,590
I'm shallow? If a wealthy lady takes me back here, what would you think?

112
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:57,308
Then go look for that rich girl.

113
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:58,809
Give it to me.

114
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,790
You even have a reason?

115
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,207
Ya.

116
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:27,012
I want you to help me with something.

117
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:28,121
I can't help.

118
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:31,970
You can, you can. You definitely can.

119
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,166
You can't go up yet.

120
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,319
What are you doing?

121
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,602
Come here. Come here. Help me with something. Thanks.

122
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:40,287
Let me go home, you.

123
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:43,734
Sit, sit. Sit first.

124
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,745
Numbs my butt.

125
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:48,811
See you got white lint all over me.

126
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:51,844
-Sorry. <br>-Say it, what's up?

127
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:58,205
It's like this, the room you're living in right now, originally was rented out by my boyfriend and me.

128
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:02,141
Three months ago, I went to do my advanced studies in Hong Kong. <br>But before I got back, I couldn't reach him.

129
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:05,240
I didn't know that he already returned the apartment.

130
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,393
I rented the house from the owner. This has nothing to do with me.

131
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:10,773
I know this has nothing to do with you,

132
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:12,731
but my mom is here.

133
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:17,731
She really disagrees with me coming to Beijing and is here to check on me.

134
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:21,635
Before she knew that I had a boyfriend and was more at rest,

135
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:23,853
but my boyfriend suddenly disappeared.

136
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:27,104
If she knew, she's definitely is going to bring me back.

137
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,312
Then look for your boyfriend, what's the use telling me?

138
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:33,519
I can't find him.

139
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,150
Then how do you expect me to help you?

140
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,139
Can you be my boyfriend?

141
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:51,165
Are you stupid?

142
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:59,123
I...I... No, don't misunderstand.

143
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:02,700
I...I... I'm saying, temporary.

144
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,146
Just pretend to be my boyfriend, just to lie to my mom.

145
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:09,767
Just lie to make her leave. I know that this is bothersome to you.

146
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:14,855
Can you please help me? My mom even saw you just now.

147
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:17,628
Just, the room that you live in right now, was originally my boyfriend's.

148
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:19,607
She saw your picture already so she..

149
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:23,586
Why do you woman all love to lie so much?

150
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:26,163
This and lying are two different things.

151
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,903
How are these two different things?

152
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:30,914
Your mom, taking care of your for so long, was it easy?

153
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:35,437
You don't take care of her well and even lie to her? <br>You're not embarrassed, but I can't even handle it.

154
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:37,090
I was afraid that she'll worry, I...

155
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,363
Would she not be sad if you lie to her? If you have something to say, say it.

156
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:45,592
Isn't it just you lost your boyfriend? Just tell you mom, she's just worried.

157
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:47,668
If you lie to her, wouldn't she be sad?

158
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:52,257
Can't you just say the truth? Especially to someone you're so close to.

159
00:12:52,257 --> 00:12:56,529
I can't stand looking at you people. The closer, the more you'll lie to them.

160
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:01,857
I'll give you a chance. Hurry, go home and tell your mom clearly.

162
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,091
I'm back.

163
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:26,831
Son, how did Xiao Tang's transferring of membership go?

164
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:30,930
One good news. One bad news.

165
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,290
How is there also bad news? What happened?

166
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,083
The bad news is that I went there late.

167
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,160
When I went, his director already was out of the hospital.

168
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,205
You, this child. How is it that what ever you do is not up to part?

169
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:48,728
I really can't just scold you. Like others have said,

170
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:53,969
"Century old pine, May's bananas" <br><i>(Chinese saying meaning) You are sloppy in doing things.</i>

171
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:57,469
Mom, but I thought of a way to make it up.

172
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,514
Say, what is it?

173
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:02,373
Our, inherited ring.

174
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,874
What inherited ring?

175
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:08,342
Mine, this one is for guys. Don't you have the one for girls?

176
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:12,745
The one that my grand-grandmother passed down to grandmother who passed it down to you.

177
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:14,822
The special one for a daughter-in-law.

178
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,964
What are you doing?

179
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:20,029
Think about it, why she would want to obtain tenure for her job.

180
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,292
Doesn't she just want stability? What else is more stable than this?

181
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,423
You want to propose to XiaoTang?

182
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:30,533
Right now, everything is ready. I just have to kneel down and propose.

183
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,447
Ha, Proposal. Young people nowadays.

184
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,545
So many troubles

185
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:37,763
You couldn’t be wanting to cling on to me?

186
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:41,894
Am I that stingy?<br>This is your biggest big thing.

187
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:44,949
As long as you two are done successfully,

188
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,092
the greatest blessings will be upon us.

189
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,266
This piece of rock in my heart would finally land.

190
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:50,864
Come on, let me get it for you.

191
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:54,038
Where did you put it? So secretive.

192
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:57,083
I hid it.

193
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:25,254
<i> Say why do you want to be in Beijing? What's so great about it?</i>

194
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:32,222
<i>Old memories surfacing to the present,</i>

195
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:40,692
<i>They don't understand, how you always adapted for me.</i>

196
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:44,498
Yu Da Hai!

197
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:49,467
You bastard, where are you? Get yourself out of here.

198
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:57,175
<i>Believing that I would be impulsive towards you.</i>

199
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:03,002
Where are you? Come out.

200
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,146
I'm worrying.

201
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:19,594
<i> If I don't see Yu Da Hai today,</i>

202
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:23,791
<i>you are coming back to Qing Island with me.</i>

203
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:32,554
<i>Your unseen panic, explaining those words I don't understand.</i>

204
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:36,446
<i>It's finally all empty</i>

205
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:40,806
<i>It's finally not painful anymore</i>

206
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:45,100
<i>This seperated our speculations</i>

207
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:54,005
<i>In the end, it finally ended</i>

208
00:16:56,842 --> 00:17:01,115
Daughter, how come you just got home?

209
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:05,052
Where were you looking for Da Hai?

210
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:11,857
-Yu Da Hai, he...<br>-Let me tell you,

211
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,738
Da Hai already came home.

212
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:16,815
And he bought this milk for me,

213
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,577
he's so considerate.

214
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:20,806
He came back?

215
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,687
Where is he?

216
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,296
In the bathroom.

217
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:31,787
Dear, why did you just get home?

218
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:40,920
If you didn't come back sooner, I would've died in the bathroom.

219
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,083
Quickly, tell me all the information.

220
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,943
Thank you, I really didn't think you would help me.

221
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:48,389
Don't say that nonsense, who am I?

222
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:51,237
You're name is Yu Da Hai. 28 years old,

223
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:55,489
A postgraduate student from the Department of Sculpture, originally from ShanDong, both your parents are living.

224
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,055
Then you?

225
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,599
I'm Yu XiaoYu, 26 years old.

226
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,165
I'm from Qing Dao of ShanDong Province, a secretary,<br> graduated from the University of Taiwan.

227
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,937
My dad passed away early so my mom took care of me.

228
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:10,830
-Then how did we meet?<br>-Renting a home.

229
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,830
We just, this house.

230
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,831
What? We already live together?

231
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:20,658
No, don't think too much. We do live together, but just together in the house.

232
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:25,540
We live in different rooms. We understand each other quite well.

233
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,672
How are young people nowadays so protective?

234
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,890
-Really. <br>-Don't misunderstand, in case your mom

235
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,108
wants us to sleep in one room, I need to look for an excuse to sleep outside.

236
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:40,762
You really don't have to. In the past, I slept separately from Yu DaiHai.

237
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,513
We haven't gotten to that step yet.

238
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:49,873
Then, that Hai person, what's his personality?

239
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:53,896
I need to know what his like.

240
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:57,168
Just say whatever. Improvise.

241
00:18:57,168 --> 00:19:00,289
My mom doesn't really know Yu Da Hai.

242
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:04,246
Just help me to make her go home, that's it.

243
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,453
Improvise?

244
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:11,270
You're asking me to act something of this high standard?

245
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,487
Sorry to have bothered you.

246
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,477
Thank you.

247
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:17,662
Oh god.

248
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:23,914
I need to thoroughly think about how to act my character. Improvise...

249
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:26,045
Studying sculptures...

250
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:30,622
Here we go! Stir fried Pork with Mu'er!

251
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:34,384
Da Hai, your cooking is so great.

252
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:37,744
I'm used to living in Beijing alone, forced to do it to survive.

253
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,886
Come, come.

254
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,115
You are from Ri Zhao?

255
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:50,215
Ya, it is just across the bridge from Qing Island.

256
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:54,476
Then how come you don't have a ShanDong accent?

257
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,988
My mom is from Beijing.

258
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,206
I know ShanDong dialect too.

259
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:01,511
As a real Qing Dao man

260
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:04,457
<i>Drink beer, eat garlic, bathe in the sea</i>

261
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:06,110
Right?

262
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,307
Say, he's pretty funny.

263
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:14,558
Have you been busy recently?

264
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,483
Mom, just eat.

265
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,483
-Just eat. <br>-I'm just caring for Da Hai.

266
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:25,039
Aunty cares for me. Aunty,

267
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,453
I have been working on a sculpture recently.

268
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:31,193
You sculpt? What do you sculpt?

269
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:35,988
Just stuff like the Statue of Liberty and Venus de Milo,

270
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:38,792
and The Thinker!

271
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,575
Do you do all the western stuff?

272
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,729
I also do Chinese ones.

273
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:47,882
The Terracotta Army!

274
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:51,894
Wow, you are too great.

275
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:58,483
Where did you throw it?

276
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,951
Just in the front. It should be here.

277
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,908
Look for it. You look in here.

278
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,377
Sorry, I really didn't think that was an antic.

279
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:13,737
It's fine.

280
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:19,108
Seeing that no one took out the trash, it's probably still here.

281
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:22,087
Are these things expensive?

282
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:25,794
A few thousand?

283
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,936
Add a zero.

284
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,481
What?

285
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:34,199
Then I can only pay you back by week.

286
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:37,461
You can't even repay it by week.

287
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:40,733
You will just have to pay it back with your body.

288
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,321
I'm kidding.

289
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:48,930
This is not worth a lot. It's the first present my girlfriend gave to me.

290
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,464
It's for memory's sake.

291
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:57,216
Your girlfriend is pretty funny. Giving you a pot for the first present.

292
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,684
That's good, a pot,

293
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:02,847
the things stewed in a pot needs small fire and patience,

294
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:05,989
it's saying that, love, through small fires and patience,

295
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:10,338
the ingredients would have nutrients.

296
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:14,840
Was she hard to chase?

297
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,885
She was our school's beauty, of course she was hard to chase. But it was her who went after me.

298
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:23,005
Talking big.

299
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:25,071
What talking big?

300
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:27,561
Hey, it's here.

301
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:29,235
Ehh.

302
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:31,039
-It's here. <br>-Let me see, let me see.

303
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,583
It's this bag, let me see.

304
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,671
It really is.

305
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:39,205
Why are you so clumsy?

306
00:22:39,205 --> 00:22:42,043
<br>

307
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:46,761
-My hands are dirty. <br>-Hurry and go back. Go back.

308
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,055
Hurry hurry.

309
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:52,426
Getting your hand cut like this...

310
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:54,774
Worrying me to death.

311
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,317
It's fine, mom.

312
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:58,765
Isn't it just a broken pot? Just throw it.

313
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:01,896
How can you throw that?

314
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:07,081
That pot, I gave it to him.

315
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:11,887
He said, this pot is like love.

316
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:15,269
Needs to slowly stew,

317
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,879
the love that can endure some cooking has taste.

318
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:22,673
And are good for people.

319
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:25,554
Da Hai, this kid is really great.

320
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,522
Get along well.

321
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:31,012
Sleep early.

324
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,456
Aunty, come over here.

325
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:52,969
Three, two, one.

326
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:01,916
I will leave Yu Er with you. It will put my heart at ease.

327
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:05,830
Aunty don't you worry! I promise to make sure she is fair and fat.

328
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:10,506
Oh, that's right.

329
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:14,963
This is my husband's gift for the future son-in-law.

330
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:18,225
Yesterday you said that pot had a special meaning.

331
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,378
This watch should convey my feelings.

332
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:23,879
The matter between you two, I agree.

333
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:28,879
Mhhm.

334
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,946
It really is a coincidence.

335
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,316
Shi.. Shi Yi. I...

336
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:39,535
<i>Who is this girl?</i>

337
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:40,894
<i>His little sister.</i>

338
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,884
<i>The picture inside your room</i>

339
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:46,276
<i>is your girlfriend right?<br>-Yeah.</i>

340
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:56,496
Shi Yi. Oh, you met your friends.

341
00:25:56,496 --> 00:25:59,105
Hello, I am Xue Liang. You are...?

342
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:01,323
Enough, enough. Don't say anymore. Let's go quickly. <br>-Hey.

343
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,281
Who was that?

344
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,825
DaHai. Who is she?

345
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,197
Mom.

346
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:20,959
Wasn't it his sister? The one you saw in the picture.

347
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:26,286
She and her boyfriend are a good match.

348
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:41,834
Mom, I'll take you to the station or else it might be too late.

349
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:48,466
Da Hai. Don't you still have things to do? <br>Go do what you need to do.

350
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,423
It's fine. I can send Aunt first.

351
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:52,706
Go do what you need to do. Work is very important.

352
00:26:52,706 --> 00:26:54,772
It's fine if Yu Er just sends me.

353
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:57,816
The next time Aunt comes back, I will give you something good to eat.

354
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,034
Yeah. Quickly go.

355
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,947
Give those things to me.

356
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:03,470
Then I'll be leaving first Aunt.

357
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,427
Alright, go.

358
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:24,128
Shi Yi. I know that you're inside.

359
00:27:24,128 --> 00:27:27,444
Open the door. Listen to what I have to say.

360
00:27:27,444 --> 00:27:30,020
That girl and I aren't what you're thinking about.

361
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,608
She's the girl who is going to rent my house.

362
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:37,088
Her boyfriend left so I was just pretending to be her boyfriend <br>so she could lie to her mother to go back home.

363
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:40,654
Shi Yi.

364
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,698
Open the door!

365
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,916
Shi Yi.

366
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:52,069
That baldy is not inside with you in your house right?

367
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,114
If you're still not opening then I'm going to knock the door down!

368
00:27:59,354 --> 00:28:00,876
Long Xia!

369
00:28:00,876 --> 00:28:02,181
This baldy really is inside!

370
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,791
Is he not an ordinary friend? What are you two?

371
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:08,595
What ordinary friend? We're boyfriend and girlfriend.

372
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:09,791
No!<br>-What relationship do you have with each other?

373
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,966
No! Listen to what I have to say!

374
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:13,706
You also like her?

375
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:15,771
Let's have a fair competition then.

376
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:18,055
Yeah right!

377
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:24,578
This person is so rough!

378
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,623
Also, just because I have less hair, doesn't mean that I'm bald!

379
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:38,277
Speak.

380
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,518
The matter is not what you think.

381
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:46,323
Xue Liang is one of our company's executives. It was my parents who introduced him to me.

382
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,216
You also know.

383
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:55,021
These years after graduating, the work I'm looking for are temporary.

384
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:58,501
I'm just trying to find a stable job.

385
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:02,415
I'm not the same as you. You are from Beijing. You are a registered resident.

386
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,459
But what about me?

387
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,634
To put it bluntly you're looking for a way of retreat.

388
00:29:07,634 --> 00:29:09,373
You have no right to say that!

389
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,200
If you could've given me that sense of security, I would not have gone to these measures.

390
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,004
How have I not given you a sense of security?

391
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:18,158
I always followed your thoughts on everything!

392
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:21,550
This is what you call a sense of security.

393
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,594
This matter is what every man should at least do.

394
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:31,770
Then who was that woman just now?

395
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,509
Didn't I already explain to you?

396
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:37,206
My roommate. I was helping that girl lie to her mother so that she can go back to Qing Dao.

397
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:38,837
It was just to help do a favor for a friend.

398
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:39,924
A friend.

399
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:41,663
All of your friends are more important than me!

400
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:43,839
Your so-called loyalty is more important than love!

401
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,209
How can you still be here talking to me about a sense of security?

402
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:50,905
Then you tell me. What is your sense of security? Say it.

403
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,342
It's stability.

404
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:59,386
Long Xia.

405
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:02,104
You have no plans for the future.

406
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,930
This month, you earned enough for you to spend.

407
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:06,497
So it's no longer necessary for you to proactive.

408
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:09,714
You could definitely have earned some extra money,

409
00:30:09,714 --> 00:30:12,651
but you always just leave it there.

410
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:14,390
You never think about,

411
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,999
what we would do if something bad happened next month.

412
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:20,478
You may get sick or I can get sick. What are we going to do then?

413
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:22,652
You don't have a plan or a future.

414
00:30:22,664 --> 00:30:25,154
How are you going to make me feel at ease?

415
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,513
Then tell me about it now.

416
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:30,731
I have always been like this since the day you met me.

417
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:33,318
You used to say you liked how I went all out for my friends.

418
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:36,569
Let's not talk about pointless stuff.

419
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,200
Then tell me what you have decided about this situation today.

420
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,594
I wish that you can understand me.

421
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:50,269
Despite how much I like you,

422
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:53,835
between us, someone has to be the stable one.

423
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:58,640
If it isn't you,

424
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,424
then it can only be me.

425
00:31:18,972 --> 00:31:21,364
Shi Yi.

426
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,919
I can forget about everything that has happened.

427
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,344
Really.

428
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:32,780
But today you must make a choice between him and me.

429
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,187
Long Xia.

430
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:53,905
I'm the one who likes you.

431
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:00,744
But you made me choose.

432
00:32:16,595 --> 00:32:17,791
I understand.

433
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,814
What I said to help that roommate

434
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:23,771
Whatever I say

435
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:27,686
I can't give you a sense of security. These are just excuses, right?

436
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:30,296
To put it bluntly, I just don't have as much ability as that guy!

437
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:35,949
Do you know what this is?

438
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:39,428
This is a ring from our ancestors.

439
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:43,234
You wanted a sense of security, a sense of stability?

440
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:46,169
I was going to make a lifelong commitment with you today.

441
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:51,388
What are you talking about?

442
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:58,129
Were you going to propose to me?

443
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:01,608
What I was going to say now is meaningless.

444
00:33:04,217 --> 00:33:09,001
<i>Flashing lights</i>

445
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:13,350
<i>A beam of light streaked across the sky</i>

446
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,830
<i>Streaked over the ocean</i>

447
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,569
LONG XIA!!

448
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:26,180
<i>Let us look up together</i><br>Long Xia!

449
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:32,703
<i>Running to find the right direction</i>

450
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:37,160
<i>That so called strength</i>

451
00:33:37,193 --> 00:33:39,999
<i>That is hope</i>

452
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:45,750
I'm back.

453
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,012
You're back. How did the talk go?

454
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,969
Good.

455
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,469
That's good. That's good.

456
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:55,753
Have you eaten yet? I made two dishes.

457
00:33:55,753 --> 00:33:57,492
I waited for you to come back so we can eat together.

458
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,211
Here.

459
00:34:00,211 --> 00:34:02,058
I just bought beer.

460
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:03,602
Why did you buy this much beer?

461
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:10,973
If there's beer, there's meat.

462
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:19,020
There's beer and meat and a woman that's accompanying me to drink.

463
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:22,498
Today is a good day.

464
00:34:23,586 --> 00:34:26,739
Eat something first. <br>-Have a sip first. Drink casually.

465
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,089
I'm really happy.

466
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:37,828
As long as you're happy.

467
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:49,680
Drink slowly. Eat something.

468
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,072
<i>If we got married, what are we going to do afterwards?</i>

469
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:55,551
<i>If we have one penny we spend one penny.</i>

470
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,073
<i>You're just like this.</i>

471
00:34:57,073 --> 00:34:59,248
<i>You don't have a plan or a future</i>

472
00:34:59,248 --> 00:35:01,966
<i>How are you going to make me feel at ease?</i>

473
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:09,141
Are you okay?

474
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:13,382
Here.

475
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,603
Should I go and explain everything to her tomorrow?

476
00:35:28,603 --> 00:35:31,321
What explanation? What could you explain?

477
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:34,583
It's nothing.

478
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:38,171
Something like this is nothing.

479
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:58,285
<i>Let me tell you. Xue Liang was the one who gave me a stable job.</i>

480
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:00,459
<i>He can make me a resident of Beijing</i>

481
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:05,461
<i>Long Xia. I wish you can understand me.</i>

482
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:11,876
<i>It's likely that every single person</i>

483
00:36:11,897 --> 00:36:16,518
<i>Has one kiss that they remember in their heart</i>

484
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,356
<i>Early in the morning, do you have</i>

485
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:24,487
<i>An impossible someone</i>

486
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:30,685
<i>This world has unlimited possibilities</i>

487
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:35,577
<i>But the more you want the less likely it is to happen</i>

488
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:42,970
<i>Just like how it is impossible for me to participate in the wrinkles on your face </i>

489
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,537
<i>I can't arrive, can't arrive, can't arrive</i>

490
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:52,397
<i>Happiness is so beautiful, please hold on to it for me</i>

491
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,540
<i>Your hands, your love, your dreams</i>

492
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,106
<i>It was never mine</i>

493
00:37:19,828 --> 00:37:21,242
Hello?

494
00:37:21,242 --> 00:37:23,089
When you are going to get to the company?

495
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,461
I...

496
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:29,287
I'll be there immediately.

497
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:32,875
I'm on the way. Okay, bye bye.

498
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,834
Ah!

499
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:48,857
Ai-ya. Aiya.

500
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,554
Aiya.

501
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:54,946
What are you doing?<br>-Sorry.

502
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:59,294
I accidentally fell on you.

503
00:37:59,294 --> 00:38:00,600
You've smashed me to death.

504
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,427
I have to report back to the company. I'm late. Continue sleeping. You can continue sleeping.

505
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:06,688
Aiyo.<br>-I'm late, I'm late.

506
00:38:06,688 --> 00:38:08,211
Aiyo.

507
00:38:10,276 --> 00:38:11,254
Aiya.

508
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,790
Hello.<br>Hello, my son.

509
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,965
How was your proposal to Xiao Tang? I was worrying about it as soon as I woke up this morning.

510
00:38:25,965 --> 00:38:28,270
I thought you said you were going to give me a surprise.

511
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,967
Mom, this matter, let's not rush it.

512
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:34,587
What do you mean let's not rush it?

513
00:38:34,587 --> 00:38:36,675
I'm worrying to death here! Do you not know?

514
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:40,980
Y-you, marriage is a big thing, more thought needs to go into it.

515
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,285
How much more do you need to think about? You two have been thinking about it for three years!

516
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:49,134
Mom, I'm at work. Let's talk about it when I get home.

517
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:52,211
No, you have to tell me-<br>Son!

518
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:57,061
This child..

519
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:24,491
Stop the car! Stop the car!

520
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:27,286
What did she see? <br>Yu Da Hai!

521
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:34,602
Stop!

522
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,919
Who are you following?

523
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:42,072
Yu Da Hai. Stop!<br>Who is it?

524
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:45,029
Hey, where are you going?

525
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:52,107
Yu Da Hai! Stop running!

526
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:54,988
Stop!

527
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:57,598
Stop!

528
00:39:57,598 --> 00:40:00,413
Stop running!

529
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:27,268
What's wrong? You've stopped following him?

530
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:33,064
Yu Da Hai threw this.

531
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:37,097
A rose? This is for talking up girls.

532
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:39,761
Does he have someone?

533
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:44,361
You don't think, he was purposefully lying to someone silly like you?

534
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:47,208
I know, I know!

535
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:54,874
Don't get agitated. You still have to report, remember?

536
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:57,962
There's no time.

537
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:09,084
Why are you in such a hurry to find me?

538
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:18,358
I-broke up with Tang Shi Yi.

539
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:20,652
Really?

540
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:25,621
Ge (Older brother), what is upsetting you? Tell me about it so I can feel happy.

541
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:27,230
Do you want to die?

542
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:31,971
This is a good thing for you! <br>You should have broken up with her ages ago!

543
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:34,493
I've always had a problem with her,

544
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,657
to be honest with you.

545
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:39,668
Okay okay, stop saying pointless stuff. Let's talk about something serious.

546
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:42,310
Today's my mom's birthday right? <br>Yeah.

547
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:49,334
I told my mum a few days ago that I was going to propose to Tang Shi Yi.

548
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:52,161
Oh yes yes, we have to keep this matter secret.

549
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:56,063
But if you are asking me to do you a favour, you must have some good faith.

550
00:41:56,063 --> 00:42:00,435
I have just taken a fancy for this necklace from Chanel.

551
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:03,783
Do you think I should buy it, or buy it, or buy it?

552
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:07,002
Oh! I think that necklace you're wearing now is very pretty.

553
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:10,840
I think you don't need to buy, don't need to buy, really don't need to buy it.

554
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,438
What are you talking about, You Lan Hai gave this to me as a present, it's so boring.

555
00:42:15,438 --> 00:42:19,450
It's really nice, it really is.<br>Are you not buying?

556
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:26,539
I'm in a bad mood, I know so much. What if i accidentally blurt something out when I get home..

557
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:28,007
Ah okay okay, how much is it?

558
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:29,703
You can just give me your credit card.

559
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:31,605
Am I brave enough to give you my credit card?

560
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:36,618
Three thousand is nothing to you. How much do you think I'm going to spend?

561
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:40,129
It's only three thousand.

562
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,327
Thank you Ge! You're always the nicest to me! Next time you break up with someone come find me again.

563
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:49,339
"Crow's mouth" <br><i>Meaning someone that says something bad, which always happens.</i>

564
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:57,819
Ah! What are you doing! You scared me!

565
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:01,722
What else could I do? I was waiting for you darling.

566
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:04,929
Waiting for me so stealthily,

567
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:06,996
are you waiting for..

568
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:08,213
another girl?

569
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,660
Hey, look at what you're saying, I wouldn't dare!

570
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,900
I wanted to give you a surprise.

571
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,411
What surprise?

572
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:18,292
Come home with me, and you will find out.

573
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:20,499
Hm, I'm not going.

574
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:22,913
There's a surprise.

575
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:26,685
What's the big deal, just tell me if it's the end or not clearly.

576
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:28,969
There's no point delaying stuff.

577
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:31,121
I am not someone who will keep on bothering you.

578
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:34,937
Can you lower your scope of attack?

579
00:43:36,504 --> 00:43:39,385
Ei, I wasn't talking about you.

580
00:43:39,385 --> 00:43:41,700
That's more like it.

581
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,299
I think that man is not scared of you bothering him.

582
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:49,920
He's scared of you asking him for money.

583
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,192
Ei, look at you guys.

584
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:57,269
Dating and renting a house, why don't you rent one room?

585
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:02,184
Who say's that people who are dating must live together! <br>We were always in different rooms!

586
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:05,565
Oh how cute. That's quite romantic.

587
00:44:05,565 --> 00:44:09,088
What romance! He's never been romantic with me.

588
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:12,795
He bought roses for other people. What has he ever bought me?

589
00:44:12,795 --> 00:44:17,253
Oh, why am I still wearing this stupid thing.

590
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:21,069
This is the only thing he ever gave me. He said he made it himself and that there is only one in the entire universe.

591
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:25,560
It represents his ever lasting love, and I actually believed him!

592
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,778
Why am I so stupid?

593
00:44:26,778 --> 00:44:29,571
Ei, this thing is actually made really well.

594
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:32,768
It looks a bit like..

595
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:34,747
Where have I seen this before?

596
00:44:34,747 --> 00:44:40,563
How have you seen it before? He made it himself, you couldn't sell it, no one would buy it!

597
00:44:40,563 --> 00:44:45,848
No, no, I have definitely seen this, somewhere..

598
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:48,675
Ei, why can't I remember..

599
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:52,643
Oh yes, do you have a picture of this Hai person?

600
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,742
Just looking at it annoys me.

601
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,603
<i>Let me introduce him to you, Yu Da Hai. This is my brother.</i>

602
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:10,615
<i>Ge, hello, my name is Yu LanHai</i>

603
00:45:10,615 --> 00:45:12,898
<i>You can just call me DaHai</i>

604
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,237
<i>Da Hai? Where have I heard this name before?</i>

605
00:45:17,237 --> 00:45:20,509
<i>Da Hai like the sea right?</i>

606
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,466
Didn't he tell you Da Hai likes the sea?

607
00:45:23,466 --> 00:45:28,293
How do you know? <br>Are you stupi? You are only one small fish in the sea!

608
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:30,914
Quickly put some clothes on, I'll take you to find him!

609
00:45:30,914 --> 00:45:34,132
Do you know him? <br>Quickly change your clothes! Quickly!

610
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:37,894
This bastard, he's even playing with my sister!

611
00:45:37,894 --> 00:45:43,982
<i></i>

612
00:45:43,982 --> 00:45:45,744
Did you wash well?

613
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:49,821
I finished washing.

614
00:45:49,821 --> 00:45:52,898
-I washed so well! <br>-Da Hai.

615
00:45:52,898 --> 00:45:56,062
Have you ever done anything wrong towards me?

616
00:45:56,062 --> 00:45:59,389
I am just about to do something bad to you now! <br>Hey!

617
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,031
They have already come looking for you!

618
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,184
What is your relation to her?

619
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:14,154
How-how did you find my house?

620
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:16,600
You wanted me to not find you right?

621
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,231
Yu Da Hai! You are such a liar!

622
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:24,764
Here you were talking about marrying me, and then you lied about the house rent and ran away!

623
00:46:24,764 --> 00:46:29,712
He also lied about your house rent? I spent money to rent this house as well!

624
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:34,985
Man Yi, listen to my explanation! I have nothing to do with her, I was dating her and we never even held hands!

625
00:46:34,985 --> 00:46:38,084
Would you call that dating!<br>You literally have no shame!

626
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:41,486
Do you not call it dating when you were spending my money?

627
00:46:41,486 --> 00:46:42,911
You're such a liar!

628
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:45,673
Hey, do you do this for a living?

629
00:46:45,673 --> 00:46:49,738
Our household matters, why are you butting in?

630
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:53,402
Household matters? Who is family with you?

631
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:57,763
Household matters? Are you crazy?

632
00:46:57,763 --> 00:47:03,732
<i></i>

633
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,201
Police, they are extremely violent!

634
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:16,311
Breaking in to my house! Beating me up!

635
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:17,964
They also ruined some of my artwork!

636
00:47:17,964 --> 00:47:21,237
What behaviour is this, they have committed crime!

637
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:24,324
Who attacked first? <br>Me!

638
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:55,364
<i>I haven't heard your prolixity in a while</i>

639
00:47:55,364 --> 00:48:00,997
<i>Old memories surfacing to the present</i>

640
00:48:00,997 --> 00:48:09,369
<i>They don't understand, you always adapt for me</i>

641
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:18,491
<i>No longer used to being on my own</i>

642
00:48:18,491 --> 00:48:26,166
<i>Believing that I would be impulsive</i>

643
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:31,951
<i>I can fill my eyes up with tears</i>

644
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:40,007
<i>Can you not smile, why aren't you looking at me</i>

645
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:46,226
<i>How is there still more hardship</i>

646
00:48:46,248 --> 00:48:50,152
<i>I finally understand</i>

647
00:48:50,152 --> 00:48:54,087
<i>I finally don't want it anymore</i>

648
00:48:54,141 --> 00:49:01,643
<i>Your unseen panic, explaining to me those words I don't understand</i>

649
00:49:01,643 --> 00:49:05,470
<i>Finally it's all empty</i>

650
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:09,232
<i>Finally it's not painful anymore</i>

651
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:14,070
<i>This separates our speculations</i>

652
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:20,365
<i>In the end, it finally ended</i>

653
00:49:20,365 --> 00:49:27,422
<i>Repeating that silence in front of each other</i>

654
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:37,489
<i>My hurt will no longer flutter, breaking the fantasy</i>

655
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:41,578
<i>Finally it's empty</i>

656
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:45,883
<i>Finally it's not painful anymore</i>
